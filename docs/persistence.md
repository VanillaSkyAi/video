# Persistence and replay

A completed `Video` is ordinary JSON owned by your application. VanillaSky
does not provide a database or hosted media store. Save the value returned by
`await video.generate(...)` with the platform-native `JSON.stringify`; there is
no SDK serializer.

Every stored video has `schemaVersion: "0.1"`. This storage version is separate
from streaming protocol `0.4`. The 0.1 policy supports the current storage
schema only: there are no compatibility aliases or implicit coercions.

## Load at the storage boundary

Treat values loaded from a database, object store, API, or file as `unknown`.
Parse them before using them in application code:

<!-- verify:persistence-example:start -->
```tsx
import { getVideoDuration, parseVideo } from "@vanillaskyai/video";
import { VideoPlayer } from "@vanillaskyai/video/react";

export function SavedVideo({ storedJson }: { storedJson: string }) {
  const savedVideo = parseVideo(JSON.parse(storedJson));

  return <>
    <p>{getVideoDuration(savedVideo)} seconds</p>
    <VideoPlayer video={savedVideo} autoPlay={false} />
  </>;
}
```
<!-- verify:persistence-example:end -->

The release verifier compiles this exact documented snippet against the packed
SDK artifact, including its root and React subpath imports.

`parseVideo(value: unknown)` validates the complete shape, known fields,
resolved brand and style, audio, metadata, unique scenes, timing, and JSON-safe
template variables. It returns a detached, deeply frozen `Video`, so later
changes to the loaded object cannot mutate player state.

Invalid data throws `VideoValidationError` with `code: "invalid_video"`.
Unknown or future storage versions throw the same error class with
`code: "unsupported_video_version"`. `<VideoPlayer video={value} />` repeats
this boundary validation and rejects the entire value before any renderer
runs; it never renders a partial future document.

## Retention

By default, completed snapshots omit raw source, creative instructions, and
the supplied-media URL index. A customer-owned route may retain individual
fields only when its privacy and deletion policy allows it:

```ts
createVideoHandler({
  authorize: verifySession,
  streamText,
  snapshotRetention: {
    source: true,
    instructions: true,
    suppliedMediaUrls: true,
  },
});
```

Opt-in values are bounded in the snapshot:

- source: 16,384 characters;
- instructions: 4,096 characters;
- supplied-media index: 16 URLs, each at most 2,048 characters.

These metadata limits do not replace a host retention policy. Renderable scene
variables may still contain a media URL when that asset is necessary for
replay. Store only approved assets and avoid signed URLs whose lifetime is
shorter than the replay window.

## Storage ownership

The host owns the database, object storage, tenant authorization, encryption,
deletion schedule, backups, quotas, and media URL expiry. Persist the final
`Video` document atomically with your own tenant and record identifiers. Do not
use the protocol checksum as an authorization or tenancy control.

The checksum on `response.complete` is a deterministic, non-cryptographic
drift detector. It is not proof of authenticity and is not a signature. Use
normal authenticated storage and a cryptographic integrity mechanism when
those properties are required.

Saved replay makes zero generation endpoint or model-provider requests. It is
not necessarily zero network traffic: audio, images, videos, fonts, and
customer-owned renderers may make separate media network requests.

When a saved video uses project-owned templates, provide the matching browser
registry: `<VideoPlayer video={savedVideo} templates={templates} />`.
