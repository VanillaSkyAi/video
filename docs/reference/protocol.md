# Video Response Protocol 0.4

## Transport

The public transport is UTF-8 Server-Sent Events returned from a `POST` request.
Responses use `Content-Type: text/event-stream`,
`x-vanillasky-video-stream: 0.4`, `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform`, and
`X-Accel-Buffering: no`. Each block has an SSE `id`, the event name
`video`, and one JSON envelope in `data`. A final `data: [DONE]`
closes the transport after a terminal protocol event. Comment heartbeats do not
change protocol state.

## Envelope

```ts
type VideoEvent<T extends string, D> = {
  protocolVersion: "0.4";
  runId: string;
  sequence: number;
  eventId: string;        // exactly `${runId}:${sequence}`
  type: T;
  data: D;
};
```

Sequences start at zero and increase by exactly one. Unknown fields are
rejected. Replaying the same `eventId` with identical content is idempotent;
replaying it with different content is an error. A run ID cannot change
midstream and events cannot follow a terminal state.

## Lifecycle

1. `response.start` establishes request ID, orientation, style, and negotiated
   templates/extensions.
2. Optional `audio.set` occurs at most once and before the first scene.
3. `scene.add` appends one trusted-template scene at revision `0`.
4. `scene.patch` or `asset.patch` advances that scene revision by exactly one.
   A host must reject patches after the scene has played.
5. Exactly one terminal event ends the run:
   `response.complete`, terminal `response.error`, or `response.abort`.

`response.complete` carries the complete replayable `Video`, a
finish reason, and a deterministic checksum. The reducer verifies that the
snapshot equals the state produced by all prior events. The checksum detects
accidental drift; it is not a cryptographic signature.

The terminal snapshot carries persisted `schemaVersion: "0.1"`. That storage
version is independent from this streaming protocol version. Load stored
snapshots through the universal `parseVideo` boundary described in the
[persistence guide](../persistence.md).

Recoverable `response.error` events may be followed by more events. Terminal
errors contain a safe public message. Provider details belong only in a private
server callback.

### Duration ceiling

`maxDurationSec` is enforced by the runtime for scene additions and timing
patches. A final scene may be shortened to the remaining duration. If a later
scene would start at the ceiling, the runtime preserves the partial response
and emits `response.complete` with `finishReason: "length"`; reaching the
declared maximum is normal completion, not a generation error. The value is a
ceiling, not a target: a grounded response may complete below that ceiling when
the source does not support another distinct readable scene.

## Extensions

Extension events use a namespaced `data.*` type, for example
`data.customer.status`. They are accepted only when the exact name was
negotiated in `response.start.capabilities.extensions`. Extensions cannot
change core video state.

## Planning boundary

LLMs do not emit public protocol envelopes. A server-only planner emits
validated `scene.add`, `scene.patch`, `asset.patch`, `plan.complete`, or
`plan.error` parts. The runtime assigns sequences, revisions, IDs, terminal
snapshots, and checksums. Generated HTML, React, JavaScript, CSS, component
source, audio events, protocol envelopes, and unknown part types are rejected.

A planner may add `placement: "closer"` to exactly one `scene.add`. The
standard handler requires that closer by default, holds it outside the public
event stream while body scenes continue, and commits it as the final scene.
Only templates advertised for `jobs:[ask]` or `jobs:[payoff]` qualify. The
placement marker is not part of `VideoScene` and never enters a replay
snapshot. If the planner completes without a valid closer, the handler emits
`plan_missing_closer` and uses `finishReason: "other"`; provider `length` and
`content-filter` reasons remain unchanged.

## Resume

A resume request repeats the public input and includes:

```json
{"resume":{"runId":"run-123","afterSequence":7}}
```

It also sends `Last-Event-ID: run-123:7`. The server validates that both cursors
match, then calls customer-owned replay storage. Replay begins at sequence `8`
and remains subject to normal run, order, validation, and terminal rules. The
SDK does not prescribe or operate a persistence service.

Validate adapter output and persisted replay logs against this protocol before
accepting them. A replay log must preserve ordering, checksums, and a terminal
event.
